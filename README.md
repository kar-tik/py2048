### Modules imported

### Initializing the board
* To initialize the board i used random.choices().
* This function returns random numbers from a list.
* We can also specify the number of numbers to be returned.
* I took four numbers randomly and then made two indices using them.
* After that i did arr[j][i] = 2 , arr[y][x] = 2 , where i,j,x,y are the random numbers returned.
